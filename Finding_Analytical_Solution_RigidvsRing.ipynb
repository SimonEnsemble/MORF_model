    "# Ring MOFs vs single site MOFs  \n",
    "One of the places we hope to find a useful applicaiton for MORFs is in gas storage, where we hope that in some cases, a MORF will be more effective at driving gas off of itself in respone to an increase in temperature than a comparable MOF without a ring. It should be noted that for any MORF the absorption isotherm looks like: $$\\langle n \\rangle_{Ring}(P) = \\dfrac{K_R \\beta P}{1+K_R \\beta P}$$ with K given by: $$K_R=K_R(\\beta; \\delta, \\epsilon_\\heartsuit, \\epsilon_\\triangle)=\\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-\\beta\\delta}}e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_\\triangle} + \\dfrac{e^{-\\beta\\delta}}{1+e^{-\\beta\\delta}}e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_\\heartsuit}$$\n",
    "   In order compare this to a non ring MOF we'll compare to the absorption iotherm of a single site MOF with no moving parts. $$\\langle n \\rangle_{Langmuir}(P) = \\dfrac{K_L \\beta P}{1+K_L \\beta P}$$ $$K_L = e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}$$\n",
    "   We would like to find when $\\frac{\\partial \\langle n \\rangle_{Ring}}{\\partial \\beta} > \\frac{\\partial \\langle n \\rangle_{Langmuir}}{\\partial \\beta}$ given $K_R = K_L$.$$e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}=\\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-\\beta\\delta}}e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_\\triangle} + \\dfrac{e^{-\\beta\\delta}}{1+e^{-\\beta\\delta}}e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_\\heartsuit}$$ $$\\epsilon = \\frac{-ln(K_R)}{\\beta}$$"
